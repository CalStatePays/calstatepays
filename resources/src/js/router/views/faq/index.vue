						<div class="p-sm-4 faq-panel">Over 670,000 students, all of whom entered one of the six participating CSU campuses as first-time freshmen, transfer students, credential or post-baccalaureate students between 1995 and 2018.</div>

						<div class="p-sm-4 faq-panel">No. Only students who remained in California, and whose earnings were covered by Unemployment Insurance at 2, 5, 10, and 15 years after education exit are included in the study. As a result, students who have moved out of state or are out of the labor market are excluded, as are those in the military, federal employment, or are self-employed. Further, the study population was limited to students who, in any given year, had no more than two (2) consecutive quarters without reported earnings.</div>

						<div class="p-sm-4 faq-panel">Employment data are provided by industry using the 2-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) classifications, rather than by occupation. Each 2-digit industry classification contains multiple related industries, for example, the Education Industry includes both K-12 education and higher education as well as other education sectors. If you don’t see an industry in a specific table, it is because only industries employing a minimum number of students are reported.</div>

						<div slot="header" class="font-weight-bold">What is Personal Financial Return on Education?</div>
						<div class="p-sm-4 faq-panel">Personal Financial Return on Education (PFRE), also called Internal Rate of Return to education, is an interest rate-like number that provides information on your financial reward for pursuing a specific bachelor's degree. During school you make an investment by paying for tuition, books and giving up the opportunity to work as much as you could if you were not attending school. After education, you enter the labor force and can earn more money than you would without the bachelor’s degree until you retire. PFRE is the implicit interest rate on this investment. The PFRE calculator is compiled based on the available CSU campuses data for undergraduate degree programs. It uses real earnings data from past CSU graduates.</div>

						<div slot="header" class="font-weight-bold">What factors affect your Personal Financial Return on Education (PFRE)?</div>
						<div class="p-sm-4 faq-panel">Things that influence your Personal Financial Return on Education (PFRE):
							<ul class="pt-4">
								<li>NOTE: All PFRE results are for students who completed a bachelor degree only.</li>
								<li>The more you could earn without a bachelor’s degree, the more earnings you give up while enrolled - decreasing PFRE. For example, transfer students with an associate degree from a community college have better opportunities to earn more while at CSU than a first-time freshman.  The income not earned while enrolled in school is often called opportunity cost.</li>
								<li>The shorter time you spend at CSU, the briefer the investment period, the lower the opportunity cost and, thus, the higher the PFRE.</li>
								<li>The more you earn while obtaining a bachelor’s degree, the less income you give up to get it--increasing PFRE. There can be other effects as well.  It might take you longer to graduate (lowering PFRE).  You also learn useful things on the job which can make your earnings after graduation greater.</li>
								<li>The more financial aid money you receive (excluding loans), the less you pay to get a bachelor’s degree - increasing PFRE.</li>
								<li>The longer it takes you to graduate, the higher your education costs - decreasing PFRE.</li>
								<li>The earlier you begin work after completing your bachelor degree, the longer you receive higher post-graduation earnings, which increases your PFRE. When older people get education, they have fewer years after graduation and prior to retirement so there is a shorter period of higher earnings and a lower PFRE.</li>
								<li>Majors that produce higher post-graduation earnings will get a higher PFRE.</li>

						<div slot="header" class="font-weight-bold">How are industries defined?</div>
						<div class="p-sm-4 faq-panel">Industries are defined using the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS).  Industries are based on the two-digit level of the taxonomy. On the attachment provided <a :href="this.url + '/NAICS.Codes.With.Majors.xlsx'" title="NAICS Codes with Majors file download.">here</a> we list each industry with its number, definition, and bachelors degrees commonly found in the industry. For example, the industry construction is associated with the NAICS code 23 and is often employed by Civil Engineering majors. <a href="https://www.naics.com/search/" target="_blank">Learn more NAICS here.</a></div>

						<div class="p-sm-4 faq-panel">This page is an extension of CalStatePays. A link to the Power Users Page can be found near the bottom left hand corner of every page. Data are in the Tableau platform which allows you to design your own data displays. It also contains some measures not included on the main site, such as, Earning while Enrolled. You may also compare earnings by key demographic groups such Age at Entry, Gender, Pell Status and Race. You can access all six campuses combined and CSUN data without a password. To access other campuses, contact the Institutional Research Office at your campus of interest for an account and password.</div>
